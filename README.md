# Machinelearning_Matrice

This involves modifying the EfficientDet-D0 model to use the CSPDarknet53 model as the
backbone and modify the head to train using two datasets at the same time.

## Overview
1. Download the Appliance Dataset and Food Dataset as your datasets for training. They are
   already in MSCOCO format.
2. Modify the EfficientDet-D0 model from EfficientDet paper to use the CSPDarknet53 model from
   the YOLOv4 paper as the backbone.
3. Add one more head to the backbone so that you can train using two datasets at the same time.
4. Modify the data preprocessing code of EfficientDet to include the data augmentation from
   YOLOv4.
5. Modify the training code to optimize for both loss from two heads using a single forward and
   backward pass.
6. Load the backbone using MSCOCO trained weights from YOLOv4 and freeze the backbone
   to train the two headed architecture on the two datasets.
7. Make predictions on a sample image containing objects from both datasets.
8. Train the architecture with a single head separately on the two datasets and compare the performance.
9. Document the code using PyLint and create a document explaining the solution and approach.
